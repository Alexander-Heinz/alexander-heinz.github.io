With two M.Sc. degrees in Psychology (University of Innsbruck) and Behavioral Data Science (University of Amsterdam), I bring a unique blend of human understanding and technical expertise to data science and engineering.

My data journey began in 2021 with an internship at Yagora, where I also completed my thesis, using Bayesian Inference and lasso-regularized regression to pinpoint factors driving food innovation success across a diverse sample of German consumers. I went on to develop consultancy / trend monitoring tools (frontend & backend) and conduct advanced analyses for leading food and FMCG brands worldwide.

Currently, I’m a Data Engineer and Software Developer at VDI-VDE/IT in Berlin, helping the company get more efficient and AI-powered, e.g., by using LLMs in chatbots.

With practical experience in both academia (tutoring, co-authoring research papers) and industry (internships and now full-time roles), I continue to push the boundaries of data science, often working on private projects in my spare time. Outside of tech, I’m passionate about sports, particularly boardsports (skateboarding, snowboarding, wakeskating, surfing), I like hitting the gym and enjoy playing piano (some older piano videoclips are here: https://www.youtube.com/@pianub7638).

I’m always open to connecting for collaboration or networking — find me on LinkedIn below my portrait!
