After graduating with a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Psychology at the University of Innsbruck, I am now pursuing another M.Sc. in Behavioral Data Science at the University of Amsterdam, which will be finished in Summer 2021. 

My passions lie in the areas of psychology (esp. Memory, Cognition & Consciousness) and Data Science (esp. Natural Language Processing, ML/AI and Visualization). 

I have practical and demonstratable experience both in academia (tutoring & research, co-authoring papers) and industry (internships at two different companies). In my free time I enjoy working on private projects. I also enjoy doing sports (esp. all kinds of boardsports) and play the piano.

Feel free to contact me for collabs and networking! You'll find me on LinkedIn below my portrait!
