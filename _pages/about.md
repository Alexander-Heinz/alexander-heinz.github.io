After graduating with a B.Sc. and M.Sc. in Psychology at the University of Innsbruck, I graduated with another M.Sc. in Behavioral Data Science at the University of Amsterdam.

In 2021, I started an internship at the company yagora where I also wrote my thesis, in which I used Bayesian Inference & Bootstrapped Lasso regression to detect food innovation success factors in a large sample of German consumers. At yagora, I now continue applying my data science skills by developing consultancy tools and complex analyses for international food and FMCG-market brands, among which are some big names that you can see on our website (https://www.yagora.com).

My passions lie in the areas of psychology (esp. Memory, Cognition & Consciousness, but actually everything that involves understanding humans ;P) and Data Science. Recently, I've been involved in more programming-intense assignments and even some web development using flask & react.js! I really like building stuff, but also reading scientific papers while diving deep into topics that sparked my interest, which can vary greatly.

I have practical and demonstratable experience both in academia (tutoring & research, co-authoring papers) and industry (internships at two different companies and now my full time job at yagora). In my free time I enjoy working on private projects. I also enjoy doing sports (esp. all kinds of boardsports) and play the piano.

Feel free to contact me for collabs and networking! You'll find me on LinkedIn below my portrait!
