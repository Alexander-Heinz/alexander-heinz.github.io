With two M.Sc. degrees in Psychology (University of Innsbruck) and Behavioral Data Science (University of Amsterdam), I combine human-centered insight with technical expertise to drive data science and engineering projects.

During my studies, I completed an internship at Oefenweb / Prowise Learn, where I contributed to the development of a dashboard for system monitoring connected to a SQL database handling millions of daily data points. My work helped identify learning modules requiring attention – such as cases where incorrect answers were marked as correct or where certain skill levels lacked appropriate questions.

After graduation, I joined Yagora for an internship and thesis project. I used Bayesian Inference and lasso-regularized regression to analyze the factors behind food innovation success among diverse German consumers. This led to my involvement in building trend monitoring tools and consultancy solutions for global FMCG brands, conducting time series forecasting and causal inference to optimize product placement in supermarkets and quantify the impact of store design changes on sales.

While I enjoyed the analytical and strategic aspects of this role, I discovered a stronger passion for software development during the creation of a monitoring tool that used web scraping algorithms to track social media posts. This project allowed me to work on both the front- and back-end, manage large datasets, and build scalable systems – blending coding with data-driven insights.

Recognizing that my previous role offered limited opportunities to expand in software development, I enrolled in two courses: LLM Zoomcamp and MLOps Zoomcamp. There, I built a RAG chatbot and gained hands-on experience in monitoring machine learning models throughout the MLOps lifecycle – covering deployment, versioning, CI/CD pipelines, and drift detection. These projects enhanced my skills in cloud computing, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and orchestrating ML workflows.

Before completing the second course, I secured my current position at VDI-VDE-IT in Berlin, where I now work as a Data Engineer and Software Developer. My focus is on driving AI-powered solutions and improving internal processes by implementing LLM-based chatbots and automation tools.

Beyond tech, I value collaboration and continuous learning. I believe that open communication, trust, and shared goals are essential for fostering innovation and creating a resilient team culture. I strive to contribute not only to technical growth but also to an environment where failures are seen as learning opportunities and success is celebrated collectively.

I’m passionate about sports, especially boardsports like skateboarding, snowboarding, wakeskating, and surfing. I also enjoy the gym and playing piano, particularly the works of Chopin and Yann Tiersen. In my creative downtime, I design merchandise for print-on-demand platforms like Merch by Amazon and Spreadshirt. I’m an investing enthusiast, follow the stock market closely, and take care of my indoor and balcony plants at home.

In my early 20s, I produced techno music using FL Studio, but time constraints have made this more of a past hobby. Nevertheless, I continue to explore new skills and interests, driven by a growth mindset and curiosity.
