With two M.Sc. degrees in Psychology (University of Innsbruck) and Behavioral Data Science (University of Amsterdam), I bring a unique blend of human understanding and technical expertise to data science and engineering.

During my studies, I completed an internship at Oefenweb / Prowise Learn, a company developing adaptive learning games, where I programmed parts of a dashboard being used for system monitoring, which connected to a SQL database with millions of data points per day. My work helped the company identify learning modules that required special attention, for example, because incorrect answers were marked as correct or because there were no suitable questions within a certain skill range. 

After my studies, I began an internship at Yagora, where I also completed my thesis, using Bayesian Inference and lasso-regularized regression to pinpoint factors driving food innovation success across a diverse sample of German consumers. I went on to develop consultancy and trend monitoring tools and conduct advanced analyses for leading food and FMCG brands worldwide. The analyses included time series forecasting and causal inference to optimize shelf placement for products in supermarkets and drugstores, as well as to evaluate and quantify the impact of shelf layouts and store design changes on sales performance. I thoroughly enjoyed this work, as it required strong analytical skills, attention to detail, and a solid understanding of consumer behavior and market dynamics. However, I found even greater satisfaction in developing the front- and back-end of a monitoring tool that leveraged web scraping algorithms to track social media posts. This project allowed me to dive deeper into software development, work with large datasets, and build scalable systems – combining my passion for coding with my interest in data-driven insights.

This project allowed me to dive deeper into software development, handle large datasets, and build scalable systems – blending my passion for coding with data-driven insights.

Since my previous role didn’t offer many opportunities to engage in software development projects at a deeper level, I decided to pursue two courses alongside my job – the LLM Zoomcamp and the MLOps Zoomcamp. During these courses, I developed a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot and gained hands-on experience in monitoring machine learning models throughout the entire MLOps lifecycle. This included everything from model deployment and versioning to CI/CD pipelines, model drift detection, and monitoring. These projects strengthened my skills in cloud computing, containerization (Docker/Kubernetes), and orchestrating machine learning workflows.

You can find the final projects from these courses in my portfolio here on the website. Interestingly, before I had even completed the second course, I secured my current position at VDI-VDE-IT.

Currently, I’m a Data Engineer and Software Developer at VDI-VDE/IT in Berlin, where I help the company become more efficient and AI-powered by implementing solutions like LLM-based chatbots and streamlining internal processes with automation and data-driven tools.

With practical experience in both academia (tutoring, co-authoring research papers) and industry (internships and now full-time roles), I continue to push the boundaries of data science, often working on private projects in my spare time. Outside of tech, I’m passionate about sports, particularly boardsports (skateboarding, snowboarding, wakeskating, surfing), I like hitting the gym and enjoy playing piano.

I would describe myself as someone with a growth mindset and a passionate learner. I tend to be a more reserved person, but I’m also open-minded, collaborative, and capable of building strong relationships with colleagues and clients. I thrive in environments where teamwork and mutual respect are valued, and I enjoy contributing to shared goals.

I’m motivated by a leadership style that emphasizes collaboration and trust, where open, constructive feedback is encouraged, and new ideas are welcomed. For me, it’s important to feel aligned with the work I do and to take pride in what we achieve as a team. At the same time, I see mistakes as valuable learning opportunities. I’m comfortable putting my ego aside and focusing on what benefits the success of the company.

Ultimately, I believe that a positive and appreciative work culture not only drives innovation but also creates an environment where everyone can perform at their best.

I’m always open to connecting for collaboration or networking — find me on LinkedIn below my portrait!
