After finishing my M.Sc. in Psychology from the University of Innsbruck, I am now pursuing another M.Sc. in Behavioral Data Science at the University of Amsterdam. 

My passions lie in the areas of psychology (esp. Cognition & Consciousness, Memory, Emotions) and Data Science (esp. Natural Language Processing, ML/AI and Visualization).

I have practical experience both in academia (tutoring & research, co-authoring papers) and industry (internships at two different companies). In my free time I enjoy working on private projects.

Feel free to contact me for collabs and networking!
