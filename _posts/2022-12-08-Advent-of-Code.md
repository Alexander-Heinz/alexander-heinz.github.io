Since 2019, I participate in the [Advent of Code Challenge](https://www.adventofcode.com). During the first two years, I only solved 3 or 4 of the riddles each time, but this year, I'm trying to get the complete 24 days! 

So far it's going well (Day 8) and I solved every day (except day 5 Part 2) so far.

Most of the code is in :snake:, some in R :goat: and some in JavaScript (I'm trying to get better at ReactJS at the moment ;).

You can see my code in the 
[Github Repository](https://github.com/AlexanderHeinzYagora/advent-of-code-2022).

Cheers,

Alex
