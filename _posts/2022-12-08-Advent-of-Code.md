Since 2019, I participate in the [Advent of Code Challenge](https://www.adventofcode.com){:target="_blank"}. During the first two years, I only solved 3 or 4 of the riddles each time. This year it's going a bit better and I managed to solve 8 days, until I couldn't find the time to participate in the challenge next to my regular full-time job.

Most of the code is in :snake:, some in R :goat: and some in JavaScript (I'm trying to get better at ReactJS at the moment ;).

You can see my code in the 
[Github Repository](https://github.com/AlexanderHeinzYagora/advent-of-code-2022){:target="_blank"}.

Cheers,

Alex
