My first `r shiny` project is a coronavirus dashboard.

I know there are already many dashboards out there, but it was for my personal practice and fun to make :) 

*Note: This app is **not** optimized for mobile.


[Click Here to open the dashboard!](https://glaswasser.shinyapps.io/Covid19/){:target="_blank"}



It features:

* Cases over time

* Availability to select multiple countries
<img src="{{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/images/covid/countries.jpg" alt="countries">

* Word Clouds containing the most frequent words of news pages related to the coronavirus

(I have ideas about extending this feature to google trends & tweets, applying topic modelling algorithms or sentiment analysis)

Data is simply loaded via [Rami Krispin's daily updated dataset:](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus){:target="_blank"}

```r
coronavirus <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/coronavirus.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
