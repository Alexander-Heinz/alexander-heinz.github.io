My first `r shiny` project is a coronavirus dashboard.

I know there are already many dashboards out there, but it was for my personal practice and fun to make :) 


[Click Here to open the dashboard!](https://glaswasser.shinyapps.io/Covid19/)



It features:

* Cases over time
* Availability to select multiple countries

* Word Clouds containing the most frequent words of news pages related to the coronavirus

(I have ideas about extending this feature to google trends, applying automatic topic modelling or sentiment analysis)

Data is simply loaded via [Rami Krispin's daily updated dataset:](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus)

```r
coronavirus <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/coronavirus.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
