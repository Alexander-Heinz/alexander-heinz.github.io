My first `r shiny` project is a coronavirus dashboard.

I know there are already many dashboards out there, but it was for my personal practice and fun to make :) 

*Note: This app is **not** optimized for mobile. I'm working on a solution. If you know a quick way to optimize shiny apps for mobile devices, please contact me (linkedin or mail: glaswasser@gmail.com)*

It features:

* Cases over time

* Availability to select multiple countries

* Word Clouds containing the most frequent words of news pages related to the coronavirus

(I have ideas about extending this feature to google trends & tweets, applying topic modelling algorithms or sentiment analysis)

Data is simply loaded via [Rami Krispin's daily updated dataset:](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus)

```r
coronavirus <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RamiKrispin/coronavirus/master/csv/coronavirus.csv", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```
